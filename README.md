# UnityExtended
Package that provides extensions and utilities I find useful when developing 3D games in Unity.
Made for personal use and expanded to public, so don't expect any support, but don't hesitate to contact me.

Use it for anything. Commercial use as well. No credits required.

The code is thoroughly documented. If you wonder what any method or utility does - just read the summary on the definition.
